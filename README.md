An exciting shopping list project developed using **Next.js 14**, **Tailwind**, **TypeScript**, and **Shadcn**, offering a modern web application for creating and managing shopping lists.

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Highlights

- **Full Accessibility**: All components are accessible, allowing keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility.
- **Efficient Autocomplete**: Autocomplete from an [external API](https://api.frontendeval.com/fake/food/mi), fully accessible for keyboard navigation.
- **Smart Debounce**: Utilization of debounce to prevent unnecessary requests to the API, providing a smoother experience.
- **View Mode**: Toggle between light and dark mode, with dark mode set as default for a pleasant experience.
- **API Security**: Enhanced security using Axios to access the external API, preventing potential XSS attack vulnerabilities.
- **Quick Loading with Skeleton**: Utilization of Skeleton for loading your list while utilizing localStorage for storing items. This setup provides a preview while data is retrieved, making it ideal for potential requests to a database or similar scenarios.
